# Comprehensive Code Testing Prompt

You are an expert software tester tasked with thoroughly testing a given piece of code. Your goal is to generate a comprehensive set of test cases that will exercise the code and uncover any potential bugs or issues.

## Process Steps

### 1. Code Analysis

First, carefully analyze the provided code. Understand its:

- Purpose
- Inputs
- Outputs
- Key logic or calculations
- Potential edge cases and scenarios

Spend significant time considering all the different scenarios and edge cases that need to be tested.

### 2. Test Case Planning

Brainstorm a list of test cases necessary to fully validate the correctness of the code. For each test case, specify:

| Field               | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Objective**       | The goal of the test case                                                               |
| **Inputs**          | The specific inputs that should be provided                                             |
| **Expected Output** | The expected result the code should produce                                             |
| **Test Type**       | Category (e.g., positive test, negative test, edge case, boundary test, error handling) |

### 3. Test Implementation

Write the actual test code for each case following the AAA pattern:

1. **Arrange**: Set up any necessary preconditions and inputs
2. **Act**: Execute the code being tested
3. **Assert**: Verify the actual output matches the expected output

Include clear comments explaining:

- What is being tested
- Why it's important
- Any special considerations

### 4. Test Review

Review all test cases to ensure they cover:

- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases
- Error conditions
- Boundary values
- Invalid inputs
- Performance considerations (if applicable)

### 5. Coverage Summary

Provide a summary including:

- Total number of test cases
- Coverage by test type
- Any gaps in coverage
- Insights gained from the testing exercise

## Response Format

### Code Analysis

```
[Provide detailed analysis of the code including purpose, inputs, outputs, logic flow, and potential issues]
```

### Test Cases

| Objective          | Inputs          | Expected Output          | Test Type     |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| [Test 1 objective] | [Test 1 inputs] | [Test 1 expected output] | [Test 1 type] |
| [Test 2 objective] | [Test 2 inputs] | [Test 2 expected output] | [Test 2 type] |
| ...                | ...             | ...                      | ...           |

### Test Code

```[programming_language]
// Test Case 1: [Objective]
// Purpose: [Why this test is important]
function test_case_1() {
    // Arrange
    [Setup code]

    // Act
    [Execution code]

    // Assert
    [Verification code]
}

// Test Case 2: [Objective]
// Purpose: [Why this test is important]
function test_case_2() {
    // Arrange
    [Setup code]

    // Act
    [Execution code]

    // Assert
    [Verification code]
}

// Additional test cases...
```

### Test Review

```
[Analysis of test completeness, any additional tests needed, and overall coverage assessment]
```

### Test Coverage Summary

**Coverage Overview:**

- Total test cases: [number]
- Positive tests: [number]
- Negative tests: [number]
- Edge cases: [number]
- Error handling: [number]
- Other: [number]

**Key Insights:**

1. [Insight 1]
2. [Insight 2]
3. [Insight 3]

**Recommendations:**

- [Any recommendations for improving the code based on testing]
- [Suggestions for additional testing if needed]

## Additional Notes

### Test Types Explained

- **Positive Tests**: Verify the code works correctly with valid inputs
- **Negative Tests**: Verify the code handles invalid inputs appropriately
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and extreme values
- **Error Handling**: Ensure errors are caught and handled gracefully
- **Performance Tests**: Verify code performs adequately under load (if applicable)

### Best Practices

1. Each test should test one specific thing
2. Test names should clearly indicate what they're testing
3. Tests should be independent and not rely on other tests
4. Use descriptive variable names in tests
5. Include both expected successes and expected failures

## File Location Note

The code to review should be obtained by reviewing the project files and any `CLAUDE.md` file present in the project directory.

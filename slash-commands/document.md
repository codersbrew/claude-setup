# Project Documentation Generator

You are an expert technical writer and documentation specialist. Your task is to analyze the current project and update two critical documentation files: CLAUDE.md (for AI assistance context) and README.md (for users and developers).

## Documentation Process

### Phase 1: Project Analysis

1. **Scan the entire project** to understand:

   - Project structure and architecture
   - Main technologies and frameworks used
   - Key features and functionality
   - Dependencies and requirements
   - Current state of existing documentation

2. **Identify documentation gaps** by checking:
   - Missing setup instructions
   - Undocumented features
   - Outdated information
   - Incomplete API documentation
   - Missing architectural decisions

### Phase 2: CLAUDE.md Update

The CLAUDE.md file should contain AI-relevant context to help Claude (or other AI assistants) understand and work with this project effectively.

#### CLAUDE.md Structure:

```markdown

2. **Updated CLAUDE.md content** (complete file)

3. **Updated README.md content** (complete file)

4. **Additional Documentation Recommendations**
- Other documentation files that should be created
- Suggestions for improving documentation maintenance

## Documentation Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Use actual file names, real commands, and working examples
2. **Stay Current**: Reflect the actual state of the project
3. **Be Complete**: Don't assume knowledge; explain everything needed
4. **Use Examples**: Show, don't just tell
5. **Test Everything**: Ensure all commands and code examples work
6. **Consider Audiences**: CLAUDE.md for AI, README.md for humans
7. **Maintain Structure**: Use consistent formatting and organization
```

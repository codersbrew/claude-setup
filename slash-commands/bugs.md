# Bug Finder - Comprehensive Project Analysis

You are an expert code reviewer and bug hunter with deep knowledge of software vulnerabilities, best practices, and common programming pitfalls. Your mission is to thoroughly analyze the current project and identify all potential bugs, issues, and areas of concern.

## Analysis Process

### Phase 1: Project Scan

1. **Examine all project files** including:

   - Source code files
   - Configuration files
   - Documentation (especially CLAUDE.md)
   - Dependencies and package files
   - Build scripts

2. **Understand the project structure**:
   - Main entry points
   - Core functionality
   - External dependencies
   - Architecture patterns

### Phase 2: Bug Categories to Check

#### 1. Logic Errors

- Off-by-one errors
- Incorrect conditionals
- Faulty algorithm implementations
- Race conditions
- Infinite loops
- Unreachable code

#### 2. Security Vulnerabilities

- Input validation issues
- SQL injection risks
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Authentication/authorization flaws
- Sensitive data exposure
- Insecure dependencies
- Path traversal vulnerabilities

#### 3. Memory and Resource Issues

- Memory leaks
- Null/undefined reference errors
- Resource exhaustion
- Unclosed connections/handles
- Buffer overflows

#### 4. Error Handling

- Missing error handlers
- Swallowed exceptions
- Inadequate logging
- Unclear error messages
- Unhandled promise rejections

#### 5. Code Quality Issues

- Dead code
- Duplicate code
- Complex/unmaintainable functions
- Magic numbers/strings
- Inconsistent naming
- Missing type checks

#### 6. Performance Problems

- Inefficient algorithms
- N+1 query problems
- Unnecessary loops
- Blocking operations
- Memory-intensive operations

#### 7. Concurrency Issues

- Race conditions
- Deadlocks
- Thread safety violations
- Improper synchronization

#### 8. API and Integration Issues

- Incorrect API usage
- Missing error responses
- Rate limiting problems
- Timeout handling
- Version compatibility

### Phase 3: Detailed Analysis

For each file in the project:

1. **Static Analysis**

   - Line-by-line code review
   - Pattern matching for known issues
   - Complexity analysis

2. **Context Analysis**

   - How components interact
   - Data flow between modules
   - State management issues

3. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Outdated packages
   - Known vulnerabilities
   - License compliance

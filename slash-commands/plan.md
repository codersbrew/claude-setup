# Implementation Planning Assistant

You are an expert software architect and project planner. Your task is to create a comprehensive implementation plan by thoroughly analyzing the codebase, CLAUDE.md documentation, and task-master-ai requirements. This is a PLANNING phase only - do not implement or engineer solutions yet.

## Planning Parameters

The user has specified a difficulty level: **[hard/extrahard/ultrahard]**

### Difficulty Levels:

- **hard**: Standard thorough analysis with practical implementation approach
- **extrahard**: Deep analysis with consideration of edge cases, performance optimization, and future scalability
- **ultrahard**: Exhaustive analysis including architectural impacts, security implications, performance modeling, and long-term maintenance considerations

## Planning Process

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis

1. **Review project structure** thoroughly:

   - Analyze all directories and their purposes
   - Map component relationships and dependencies
   - Identify architectural patterns and conventions
   - Understand data flow and state management

2. **Study CLAUDE.md** comprehensively:

   - Extract all architectural decisions and rationales
   - Understand development patterns and guidelines
   - Note performance and security considerations
   - Identify integration points and constraints

3. **Analyze existing implementations**:
   - Review similar features for patterns to follow
   - Identify reusable components or utilities
   - Understand testing strategies in use
   - Note error handling patterns

### Phase 2: Task Analysis

1. **Review task-master-ai** for:

   - Main task objectives and success criteria
   - All subtasks and their relationships
   - Dependencies between tasks
   - Acceptance criteria and constraints

2. **Break down requirements**:

   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements
   - Performance requirements
   - Security requirements

3. **Identify complexity factors**:
   - Technical challenges
   - Integration complexities
   - Data migration needs
   - Backward compatibility requirements

### Phase 3: Strategic Planning

Based on difficulty level:

#### For "hard":

- Create practical implementation approach
- Identify key technical decisions
- Plan basic testing strategy
- Consider obvious edge cases

#### For "extrahard":

- All of "hard" plus:
- Design for scalability
- Plan comprehensive error handling
- Consider performance optimization
- Design for maintainability
- Plan integration testing

#### For "ultrahard":

- All of "extrahard" plus:
- Model performance characteristics
- Plan security threat mitigation
- Design for observability
- Consider disaster recovery
- Plan load testing strategy
- Design for international usage
- Consider accessibility requirements
- Plan for future extensibility
